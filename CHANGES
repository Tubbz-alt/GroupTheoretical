+0.0.0.4 updated some list initialization routines to use NullMat
+0.0.0.5 moved fusion rule function into its own file (previously in DwG_data).
+0.0.0.5 moved get_cohomology funciton into its own file (previous in DwG_data).
+0.0.0.6 renamed functions in DwG_data to reflect their specialized use.
